## About This Project
### Project Description
This little .NET application shows the current shop and map rotation, and can be used to look up the stats of any Apex Legends player.
Written in C# for a Tool Development assignment at [Digital Arts and Entertainment](https://www.digitalartsandentertainment.be/), Howest Belgium.

### Why Apex Legends?
I decided to use this API for my assignment, not only because I am a huge Apex Legends fan, but also because it's a big dream of mine to one day land a job at Respawn Entertainment (We're allowed to dream big, right?). Apex Legends also ties in nicely with my studies at DAE.

## Project API's
This project uses the following API's to fetch its data:
- [Apex Legends Status API](https://portal.apexlegendsapi.com/): Used to fetch the current shop and map rotation.
- [Tracer Network's API](https://apex.tracker.gg/site-api): Used to fetch a detailed player overview.
